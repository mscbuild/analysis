 # Data Analysis with Python & R

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of tools and techniques for performing data analysis using **Python** and **R**. The goal is to demonstrate how to leverage the strengths of both programming languages for analyzing and visualizing data. Python is commonly used for data manipulation, machine learning, and automation, while R excels in statistical analysis and visualization.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find various Jupyter Notebooks and R Scripts showcasing different aspects of data analysis:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and insights generation
- **Machine Learning:** Predictive modeling, feature engineering, and evaluation
- **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression analysis (with R)
- **Data Visualization:** Using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `ggplot2` for insightful visual representations

This project is intended for anyone interested in learning how to apply Python and R for real-world data analysis tasks.
